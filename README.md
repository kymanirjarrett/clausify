```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

**Option A - Interactive Setup (Recommended):**
```bash
npm run setup-env
```
This interactive script will guide you through entering all required API keys.

**Option B - Manual Setup:**
```bash
# Copy template
cp .env.example .env.local  # Mac/Linux
# OR
copy .env.example .env.local  # Windows

# Then edit .env.local with your actual values
```

**Option C - Quick Copy (if you already have values):**
```bash
npm run copy-env
# Then paste your values into .env.local
```

### 4. Verify Environment Configuration

```bash
npm run verify-env
```

This command checks that all required environment variables are properly set.

### 5. Set Up Supabase Database

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy the contents of `lib/db/schema.sql`
5. Paste and run the query

### 6. Configure Supabase Storage

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase dashboard
2. Create a new bucket named `contracts`
3. Set it to **Private**
4. Configure storage policies (see documentation in schema.sql)

### 7. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

## 🔄 Multi-Machine Development

Working across multiple computers? We've got you covered:

```bash
# On new machine after cloning
npm install
npm run setup-env    # Interactive setup
npm run verify-env   # Verify configuration
npm run dev          # Start developing
```

See the [Multi-Machine Setup Guide](docs/multi-machine-setup.md) for detailed instructions on managing environment variables across development machines.

## 📊 Database Schema

### Main Tables

- **contracts** - Stores uploaded contract metadata
- **clauses** - Extracted clauses with risk analysis
- **standard_clauses** - Library of industry-standard clauses for comparison

See `lib/db/schema.sql` for complete schema.

## 🤖 AI Integration

Clausify uses a multi-provider AI strategy:

1. **Primary**: Groq API with Llama 3.1 70B (fast, free, accurate)
2. **Backup**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (if Groq fails)
3. **Embeddings**: Sentence transformers for semantic search

### Prompt Engineering

The contract analysis prompt is optimized for freelancer-specific concerns:
- Payment terms fairness
- IP rights protection
- Liability limitations
- Non-compete reasonability
- Termination clause clarity

See `lib/ai/prompts.ts` for full prompts.
